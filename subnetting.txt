Subnetting 
-------------
Create four subnets from the following IP 198.67.23.0

Method of calculating number of subnets
NB: No of subnets = 2^n

Steps taken when subnetting
-----------------------------------------
STEP 1: IP breakdown
Class		SubnetMask		CIRDRange
C		255.255.255.0		198.67.23.0/24

STEP 2: Convert the IP from Decimal to Binary
	198.67.23.0 => 11000110.01000011.00010111.00000000

>	198	70	6	6	6	6	2	0
	128	64	32	16	8	4	2	1
	1	1	0	0	0	1	1	0

>       67	67      3       3       3       3       3       1
        128     64      32      16      8       4       2       1
        0       1       0       0       0       0       1       1

>       23	23      23      23      7       7       3       1
        128     64      32      16      8       4       2       1
        0       0       0       1       0       1       1       1

>       198     70      6       6       6       6       2       0
        128     64      32      16      8       4       2       1
        1       1       0       0       0       1       1       0
SUbnet 255.255.255.0 to binary : 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000

STEP 3: Calculate the number of host bits that can be given to the network portion
	as required by the subnets
	No. of Subnets = 2^n
	n = 2 (from 2^2=4)

	11000110.01000011.00010111.00000000
	we add two bits (1) to the last binary
	11000110.01000011.00010111.11000000
	New CIDR RAnge for IP = 198.67.23.0/26
	New SUBNET mask binary = 11111111.11111111.11111111.11000000
	New Subnet mask decimal = 255.255.255.196

STEP 4 : Identify the four subnet ranges
	New Subnet mask in binary = 11111111.11111111.11111111.11000000
	NB : the last part of the IP address is the host portion
	number of useable hosts = 2^n - 2
	number of total hosts	= 2^n
				= 2^6 = 64

	198.67.23.0 to 4 subnets
	1st subnet range = 198.67.23.0 to 198.67.23.63 (+63)
	2nd subnet range = 198.67.23.64 to 198.67.23.127 (+63)
	3rd subnet range = 198.67.23.128 to 198.67.23.191 (+63)
	4th subnet range = 198.67.23.192 to 198.67.23.255

	198.67.23.0 to 5 subnets
	5 = 2^n
	128	64	32	16	8	4	2	1
	^7	^6	^5	^4	^3	^2	^1	^0
	in this case we take higher power , that is, ^3 because 5
	is not a power of 2
	therefore, 8 = 2^3
	
	Number of host bits required(n)to be added to the network=3
	New subnet mask in binary = 11111111.11111111.11111111.11100000
								(the 3 power
								adds the 3 1s)
	Number of total hosts = 2^n
				= 2^5 = 3
	We will have a total of 32 hosts per subnet - includes the network 
	and the 

	1st subnet range = 198.67.23.0 to 198.67.23.31
	2nd subnet range = 198.67.23.32 to 198.67.23.63
	3rd subnet range = 198.67.23.64 to 198.67.23.95
	4th subnet range = 198.67.23.96 to 198.67.23.127
	5th subnet range = 198.67.23.128 to 198.67.23.159
